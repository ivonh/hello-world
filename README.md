# hello-world
This is a tutorial 
I'm following this tutorial because I have a project for school that is part of that course.
I'm hoping I can learn more and get a greater understanding of how to use Git and how to code in Java
Im already feeling overwhelmed because our techer is racing through content/\.
I guess programming isnt for everyone but I have so many ideas I want to bring to life I must perservere.
